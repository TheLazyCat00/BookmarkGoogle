### üì± Mobile Devices
Due to mobile browser limitations, installation requires creating a bookmarklet:

1. **Create the bookmarklet**:
   - Add a new bookmark/favorite in your mobile browser
   - Instead of a URL, paste the contents of `script/minified.js` from this repository
   - Save the bookmark with a recognizable name (e.g., "Extract Map Data")

2. **Usage**:
   - Navigate to Google Maps and select a location
   - Tap your bookmarklet to run the script
   - The formatted data will be copied to your clipboard

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Extract Location Data**:
   - Open Google Maps in your browser
   - Click on any location (restaurant, store, landmark, etc.)
   - The extension will automatically copy the formatted data

2. **Import to Obsidian**:
   - Open your Obsidian vault
   - Paste the copied content into any note
   - The location will automatically appear in your Map View

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If there's interest, I can add the option to change the formatting for other uses. However, this will not be implemented until there are requests for the feature.
